              <p>Subject: Filming Collaboration Request — EZE IRL Controlled Test Stream</p>
              <p>Hi [MANAGER NAME],</p>
              <p>My name is Ezekiel Cruz. I&apos;m a Los Angeles-based content creator building EZE IRL — a fitness and real-life media brand. I create gym challenge content, livestreams, and short-form videos focused on authentic training and real-life experiences.</p>
              <p>I&apos;m planning a small, two-person livestream at a local gym on September 5, 2026 — a 60 to 90-minute gym session combined with a fitness challenge. I&apos;m reaching out to ask if [GYM NAME] would be open to hosting the session and allowing us to film and livestream on the premises with your written permission.</p>
              <p>Our production footprint is minimal: two people, handheld camera and phone, no lighting rigs or large equipment. We would follow all facility rules, avoid restricted areas, and respect all members&apos; privacy throughout.</p>
              <p>I believe this is a genuine opportunity to showcase [GYM NAME] to a growing fitness audience — people who train seriously and are looking for a gym community.</p>
              <p>Would you be open to a brief conversation or email exchange to discuss the details? I&apos;m happy to answer any questions about the production, provide more information about the channel, or sign any required filming authorization documents.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
